This question is split into three different parts finish as much as you can with the time provided. It would be preferred if you 
used hooks to solve this problem. Bonus points if you dont need to use useEffect.

First, take a look at the data.js file, you will see that the App component is being passed an array of objects with some names.
Iterate through the names and display them inside of a list tag.

Write state handling so that when we click on one of the names in the list it will "focus" that element, you can represent 
this with a visual if it helps but it isnt neccisary to do so. If you can prove that its being selected thats all that matters, we are going to use
this functionality on the next part.

Lastly add an input box and a button that allows us to set the middle name value for the selected name.

So if I click on the name "Amy Williams" and then type "Lee" in the input box and click the button, its expected that the name on the list will update to 
"Amy Lee Williams"
